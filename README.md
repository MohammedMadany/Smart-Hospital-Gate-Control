# Smart-Hospital-Gate-Control
IoT-based smart hospital gate for emergency priority using Raspberry Pi.

Problem: In hospitals, vehicle gates can cause delays for emergency ambulances, potentially risking lives. Manual gate control is inefficient, and non-emergency vehicles shouldn't get priority.
Solution (Application): A smart gate system that:

Detects approaching vehicles using ultrasonic sensor.
Classifies if it's an ambulance using camera AI (ready model from Hugging Face/Roboflow) or sound sensor (siren detection).
Opens the gate (servo) faster/from longer distance for emergencies.
Displays status on LCD.
Monitors/remotely controls via Blynk app (e.g., view distance, status, manual override).
